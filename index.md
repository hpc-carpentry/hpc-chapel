<!-- This is a new lesson built with [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench].  -->
<!-- [workbench]: https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs -->

This workshop is an introduction to parallel programming in Chapel. This material is designed for Day 2 of HPC Carpentry.

By the end of this workshop, students will know:

- the basic syntax of Chapel codes,
- how to run single-locale Chapel codes,
- how to write task-parallel codes for a shared-memory compute node,
- how to run multi-locale Chapel codes,
- how to write domain-parallel codes for a distributed-memory cluster.

**NOTE**: This is the draft HPC Carpentry release. Comments and feedback are welcome.
