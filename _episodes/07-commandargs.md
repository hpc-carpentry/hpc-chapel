From the last run of our code, we can see that 500 iterations is not enough to get to a _steady state_ (a state where the difference in temperature does not vary too much, i.e. `curdif`<`mindif`). Now, if we want to change the number of iterations we would need to modify `niter` in the code, and compile it again. What if we want to change the number of rows and columns in our grid to have more precision, or if we want to see the evolution of the temperature at a different point (x,y)? The answer would be the same, modify the code and compile it again!

No need to say that this would be very tedious and inefficient. A better scenario would be if we can pass the desired configuration values to our binary when it is called at the command line. The Chapel mechanism for this is to use **_config_** variables. When a variable is declared with the `config` keyword, in addition to `var` or `const`, like this:

~~~
config const niter = 500;    //number of iterations
~~~
{:.source}

~~~
>> chpl base_solution.chpl -o base_solution
~~~
{:.input}

it can be initialized with a specific value, when executing the code at the command line, using the syntax:

~~~
>> ./base_solution --niter=3000
~~~
{:.input}

~~~
The simulation will consider a matrix of 100 by 100 elements,
it will run up to 3000 iterations, or until the largest difference
in temperature between iterations is less than 0.0001.
You are interested in the evolution of the temperature at the position (1,100) of the matrix...

and here we go...
Temperature at iteration 0: 25.0
Temperature at iteration 20: 2.0859
Temperature at iteration 40: 1.42663
...
Temperature at iteration 2980: 0.793969
Temperature at iteration 3000: 0.793947

Final temperature at the desired position after 3000 iterations is: 0.793947
The greatest difference in temperatures between the last two iterations was: 0.000350086

> ## Exercise 4
> Make `n`, `x`, `y`, `mindif`, `rows` and `cols` configurable variables, and test the code simulating different configurations. What can you conclude about the performance of the code?
>> ## Solution
>> For example, lets use a 650 x 650 grid and observe the evolution of the temperature at the position (200,300) for 10000 iterations or until the difference of temperature between iterations is less than 0.002; also, let's print the temperature every 1000 iterations.
