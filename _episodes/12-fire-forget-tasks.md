A Chapel program always start as a single main thread. You can then start concurrent tasks with the `begin` statement. A task spawned by the `begin` statement will run in a different thread while the main thread continues its normal execution. Consider the following example:
 
 ~~~
 var x=0;

writeln("This is the main thread starting first task");
begin
{
  var c=0;
  while c<100
  {
    c+=1;
    writeln('thread 1: ',x+c);
  }
}

writeln("This is the main thread starting second task");
begin
{
  var c=0;
  while c<100
  {
    c+=1;
    writeln('thread 2: ',x+c);
  }
}

writeln('this is main thread, I am done...');

thread 2: 99
thread 1: 97
thread 2: 100
thread 1: 98
thread 1: 99
thread 1: 100

As you can see the order of the output is not what we would expected, and actually it is completely unpredictable. This is a well known effect of concurrent tasks accessing the same shared resource at the same time (in this case the screen); the system decides in which order the tasks could write to the screen.

A slightly more structured way to start concurrent tasks in Chapel is by using the `cobegin`statement. Here you can start a block of concurrent tasks, one for each statement inside the curly brackets. The main difference between the `begin`and `cobegin` statements is that with the `cobegin`, all the spawned tasks are synchronized at the end of the statement, i.e. the main thread won't continue its execution until all tasks are done. 

~~~
var x=0;
writeln("This is the main thread, my value of x is ",x);

cobegin
{
  {
    var x=5;
    writeln("this is task 1, my value of x is ",x);
  }
  writeln("this is task 2, my value of x is ",x);
}

writeln("this message won't appear until all tasks are done...");
~~~
{:.source}

~~~
 >> chpl cobegin_example.chpl -o cobegin_example
 >> ./cobegin_example
 ~~~
 {:.input}
 
 ~~~
This is the main thread, my value of x is 0
this is task 2, my value of x is 0
this is task 1, my value of x is 5
this message won't appear until all tasks are done...
 ~~~
 {:.output}

As you may have conclude from the Discussion exercise above, the variables declared inside a task are accessible only by the task, while those variables declared in the main task are accessible to all tasks. 

The last, and most useful way to start concurrent/parallel tasks in Chapel, is the `coforall` loop. This is a combination of the for-loop and the `cobegin`statements. The general syntax is:

```
coforall index in iterand 
{instructions}
```
This will start a new task, for each iteration. Each tasks will then perform all the instructions inside the curly brackets. Each task will have a copy of the variable **_index_** with the corresponding value yielded by the iterand. This index allows us to _customize_ the set of instructions for each particular task. 

~~~
var x=1;
config var numoftasks=2;

writeln("This is the main task: x = ",x);

coforall taskid in 1..numoftasks do 
{
  var c=taskid+1;
  writeln("this is task ",taskid,": x + ",taskid," = ",x+taskid,". My value of c is: ",c);
}

writeln("this message won't appear until all tasks are done...");
~~~
{:.source}

~~~
 >> chpl coforall_example.chpl -o coforall_example
 >> ./coforall_example --numoftasks=5
 ~~~
 {:.input}
 
 ~~~
This is the main task: x = 1
this is task 5: x + 5 = 6. My value of c is: 6
this is task 2: x + 2 = 3. My value of c is: 3
this is task 4: x + 4 = 5. My value of c is: 5
this is task 3: x + 3 = 4. My value of c is: 4
this is task 1: x + 1 = 2. My value of c is: 2
this message won't appear until all tasks are done...
 ~~~
 {:.output}
 
Notice how we are able to customize the instructions inside the coforall, to give different results depending on the task that is executing them. Also, notice how, once again, the variables declared outside the coforall can be read by all tasks, while the variables declared inside, are available only to the particular task. 

> ## Exercise 1
> Would it be possible to print all the messages in the right order? Modify the code in the last example as required.

> Hint: you can use an array of strings declared in the main task, where all the concurrent tasks could write their messages in the corresponding position. Then, at the end, have the main task printing all elements of the array in order.

>> We use the coforall to spawn tasks that work concurrently in a fraction of the array. The trick here is to determine, based on the _taskid_, the initial and final indices that the task will use.

>> ## Key idea
>> It is always a good idea to check whether there is _built-in_ functions or methods in the used language, that can do what we want to do as efficiently (or better) than our house-made code. In this case, the _reduce_ statement reduces the given array to a single number using the given operation (in this case max), and it is parallelized and optimized to have a very good performance.

The code in these last Exercises somehow _synchronize_ the tasks to obtain the desired result. In addition, Chapel has specific mechanisms task synchronization, that could help us to achieve fine-grained parallelization.
