The keyword `sync` provides all sorts of mechanisms to synchronize tasks in Chapel. 

We can simply use `sync` to force the _parent_ task to stop and wait until its _spawned-child-task_ ends.

~~~
var x=0;
writeln("This is the main thread starting a synchronous task");

sync
{
  begin
  {
    var c=0;
    while c<10
    {
      c+=1;
      writeln('thread 1: ',x+c);
    }
  }
}
writeln("The first task is done...");

writeln("This is the main thread starting an asynchronous task");
begin
{
  var c=0;
  while c<10
  {
    c+=1;
    writeln('thread 2: ',x+c);
  }
}

writeln('this is main thread, I am done...');

A more elaborated and powerful use of `sync` is as a type qualifier for variables. When a variable is declared as _sync_, a state that can be **_full_** or **_empty_** is associated to it.  

To assign a new value to a _sync_ variable,  its state must be _empty_ (after the assignment operation is completed, the state will be set as _full_). On the contrary, to read a value from a _sync_ variable, its state must be _full_ (after the read operation is completed, the state will be set as _empty_ again).

~~~
var x: sync int, a: int;
writeln("this is main task launching a new task");
begin {
  for i in 1..10 do writeln("this is new task working: ",i);
  x = 2;
  writeln("New task finished");
}

writeln("this is main task after launching new task... I will wait until  it is done");
a = x;   // don't run this line until the variable x is written in the other task
writeln("and now it is done");

There are a number of methods defined for _sync_ variables. Suppose _x_ is a sync variable of a given type, 

~~~
// general methods
x.reset()	//will set the state as empty and the value as the default of x's type
x.isfull()	//will return true is the state of x is full, false if it is empty

//blocking read and write methods
x.writeEF(value)	//will block until the state of x is empty, 
			//then will assign the value,  and set the state to full 
x.writeFF(value)	//will block until the state of x is full, 
			//then will assign the value, and leave the state as full
x.readFE()		//will block until the state of x is full, 
			//then will return x's value, and set the state to empty
x.readFF()		//will block until the state of x is full, 
			//then will return x's value, and leave the state as full

//non-blocking read and write methods
x.writeXF(value)	//will assign the value no matter the state of x, and then set the state as full
x.readXX()		//will return the value of x regardless its state. The state will remain unchanged
~~~

Chapel also implements **_atomic_** operations with variables declared as `atomic`, and this provides another option to synchronize tasks. Atomic operations run completely independently of any other thread or process. This means that when several tasks try to write an atomic variable, only one will succeed at a given moment, providing implicit synchronization between them. There is a number of methods defined for atomic variables, among them `sub()`, `add()`, `write()`, `read()`, and `waitfor()` are very useful to establish explicit synchronization between tasks, as showed in the next code:

~~~
var lock: atomic int;
const numtasks=5;

lock.write(0);  //the main task set lock to zero

coforall id in 1..numtasks
{
    writeln("greetings form task ",id,"... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello");
    lock.add(1);				//task id says hello and atomically adds 1 to lock
    lock.waitFor(numtasks);			//then it waits for lock to be equal numtasks (which will happen when all tasks say hello)
    writeln("task ",id," is done...");
}

greetings form task 5... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello
greetings form task 2... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello
greetings form task 3... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello
greetings form task 1... I am waiting for all tasks to say hello
task 1 is done...
task 5 is done...
task 2 is done...
task 3 is done...
task 4 is done...

Finally, with all the material studied so far, we should be ready to parallelize our code for the simulation of the heat transfer equation.
