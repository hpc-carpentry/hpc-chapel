The parallelization of our base solution for the heat transfer equation can be achieved following the ideas of Exercise 2. The entire grid of points can be divided and assigned to multiple tasks. Each tasks should compute the new temperature of its assigned points, and then we must perform a **_reduction_**, over the whole grid, to update the greatest difference in temperature. 

For the reduction of the grid we can simply use the `max reduce` statement, which is already parallelized. Now, let's divide the grid into `rowtasks` x `coltasks` sub-grids, and assign each sub-grid to a task using the `coforall` loop (we will have `rowtasks*coltasks` tasks in total).

~~~
config const rowtasks = 2;
config const coltasks = 2;

// this is the main loop of the simulation
curdif = mindif;
while (c<niter && curdif>=mindif) do {
  c += 1;

  coforall taskid in 0..coltasks*rowtasks-1 do {
    for i in rowi..rowf do {
      for j in coli..colf do {
        temp[i,j] = (past_temp[i-1,j]+past_temp[i+1,j]+past_temp[i,j-1]+past_temp[i,j+1]) / 4;
      }
    }
  }

  curdif = max reduce (temp-past_temp);
  past_temp = temp;
  
  if c%n == 0 then writeln('Temperature at iteration ',c,': ',temp[x,y]);
}
~~~

Note that now the nested for loops run from `rowi` to `rowf` and from `coli` to `colf` which are, respectively, the initial and final row and column of the sub-grid associated to the task `taskid`. To compute these limits, based on `taskid`, we can again follow the same ideas as in Exercise 2.

~~~
config const rowtasks = 2;
config const coltasks = 2;

const nr = rows/rowtasks;
const rr = rows-nr*rowtasks;
const nc = cols/coltasks;
const rc = cols-nc*coltasks;

// this is the main loop of the simulation
curdif = mindif;
while (c<niter && curdif>=mindif) do {
  c+=1;

  coforall taskid in 0..coltasks*rowtasks-1 do {
    var rowi, coli, rowf, colf: int;
    var taskr, taskc: int;

    taskr = taskid/coltasks;
    taskc = taskid%coltasks;

    if taskr<rr then {
      rowi=(taskr*nr)+1+taskr;
      rowf=(taskr*nr)+nr+taskr+1;
    }
	else {
      rowi = (taskr*nr)+1+rr;
      rowf = (taskr*nr)+nr+rr;
    }

    if taskc<rc then {
      coli = (taskc*nc)+1+taskc;
      colf = (taskc*nc)+nc+taskc+1;
    }
    else {
      coli = (taskc*nc)+1+rc;
      colf = (taskc*nc)+nc+rc;
    }

    for i in rowi..rowf do {
      for j in coli..colf do {
	  ...
	
}

As you can see, to divide a data set (the array `temp` in this case) between concurrent tasks, could be cumbersome. Chapel provides high-level abstractions for data parallelism that take care of all the data distribution for us. We will study data parallelism in the following lessons, but for now, let's compare the benchmark solution with our `coforall` parallelization to see how the performance improved. 

~~~

The simulation will consider a matrix of 650 by 650 elements,
it will run up to 10000 iterations, or until the largest difference
in temperature between iterations is less than 0.002.
You are interested in the evolution of the temperature at the position (200,300) of the matrix...

and here we go...
Temperature at iteration 0: 25.0
Temperature at iteration 1000: 25.0
Temperature at iteration 2000: 25.0
Temperature at iteration 3000: 25.0
Temperature at iteration 4000: 24.9998
Temperature at iteration 5000: 24.9984
Temperature at iteration 6000: 24.9935
Temperature at iteration 7000: 24.9819

The simulation took 17.0193 seconds
Final temperature at the desired position after 7750 iterations is: 24.9671
The greatest difference in temperatures between the last two iterations was: 0.00199985

This parallel solution, using 4 parallel tasks, took around 17 seconds to finish. Compared with the ~20 seconds needed by the benchmark solution, seems not very impressive. To understand the reason, let's analyze the code's flow. When the program starts, the main thread does all the declarations and initializations, and then, it enters the main loop of the simulation (the **_while loop_**). Inside this loop, the parallel tasks are launched for the first time. When these tasks finish their computations, the main task resumes its execution, it updates `curdif`, and everything is repeated again. So, in essence, parallel tasks are launched and resumed 7750 times, which introduces a significant amount of overhead (the time the system needs to effectively start and destroy threads in the specific hardware, at each iteration of the while loop). 

Clearly, a better approach would be to launch the parallel tasks just once, and have them executing all the simulations, before resuming the main task to print the final results. 

~~~
config const rowtasks = 2;
config const coltasks = 2;

const nr = rows/rowtasks;
const rr = rows-nr*rowtasks;
const nc = cols/coltasks;
const rc = cols-nc*coltasks;

// this is the main loop of the simulation
curdif = mindif;
coforall taskid in 0..coltasks*rowtasks-1 do {
  var rowi, coli, rowf, colf: int;
  var taskr, taskc: int;
  var c = 0;

  taskr = taskid/coltasks;
  taskc = taskid%coltasks;

  if taskr<rr then {
    rowi = (taskr*nr)+1+taskr;
    rowf = (taskr*nr)+nr+taskr+1;
  }
  else {
    rowi = (taskr*nr)+1+rr;
    rowf = (taskr*nr)+nr+rr;
  }

  if taskc<rc then {
    coli = (taskc*nc)+1+taskc;
    colf = (taskc*nc)+nc+taskc+1;
  }
  else {
    coli = (taskc*nc)+1+rc;
    colf = (taskc*nc)+nc+rc;
  }

  while (c<niter && curdif>=mindif) do {
    c = c+1;
    
    for i in rowi..rowf do {
      for j in coli..colf do {
        temp[i,j] = (past_temp[i-1,j]+past_temp[i+1,j]+past_temp[i,j-1]+past_temp[i,j+1])/4;
      }
    }
        
    //update curdif
    //update past_temp
    //print temperature in desired position
  }
}

The problem with this approach is that now we have to explicitly synchronize the tasks. Before, `curdif` and `past_temp` were updated only by the main task at each iteration; similarly, only the main task was printing results. Now, all these operations must be carried inside the coforall loop, which imposes the need of synchronization between tasks. 

The synchronization must happen at two points: 
1. We need to be sure that all tasks have finished with the computations of their part of the grid `temp`, before updating `curdif` and `past_temp` safely.
2. We need to be sure that all tasks use the updated value of `curdif` to evaluate the condition of the while loop for the next iteration.

To update `curdif` we could have each task computing the greatest difference in temperature in its associated sub-grid, and then, after the synchronization, have only one task reducing all the sub-grids' maximums.

~~~
var curdif: atomic real;
var myd: [0..coltasks*rowtasks-1] real;
...
//this is the main loop of the simulation
curdif.write(mindif);
coforall taskid in 0..coltasks*rowtasks-1 do
{
  var myd2: real;
  ...
  
  while (c<niter && curdif>=mindif) do {
    c = c+1;
    ...
  
    for i in rowi..rowf do {
      for j in coli..colf do {
        temp[i,j] = (past_temp[i-1,j]+past_temp[i+1,j]+past_temp[i,j-1]+past_temp[i,j+1])/4;
        myd2 = max(abs(temp[i,j]-past_temp[i,j]),myd2);
      }
    }
    myd[taskid] = myd2
    
    // here comes the synchronization of tasks
    
    past_temp[rowi..rowf,coli..colf] = temp[rowi..rowf,coli..colf];
    if taskid==0 then {
      curdif.write(max reduce myd);
      if c%n==0 then writeln('Temperature at iteration ',c,': ',temp[x,y]);
    }
    
    // here comes the synchronization of tasks again
  }
}

to see that we now have a code that performs 5x faster. 

We finish this section by providing another, elegant version of the 2D heat transfer solver (without time
stepping) using data parallelism on a single locale:

~~~
const n = 100, stride = 20;
var T: [0..n+1, 0..n+1] real;
var Tnew: [1..n,1..n] real;
var x, y: real;
for (i,j) in {1..n,1..n} { // serial iteration
  x = ((i:real)-0.5)/n;
  y = ((j:real)-0.5)/n;
  T[i,j] = exp(-((x-0.5)**2 + (y-0.5)**2)/0.01); // narrow gaussian peak
}
coforall (i,j) in {1..n,1..n} by (stride,stride) { // 5x5 decomposition into 20x20 blocks => 25 tasks
  for k in i..i+stride-1 { // serial loop inside each block
    for l in j..j+stride-1 do {
      Tnew[k,l] = (T[k-1,l] + T[k+1,l] + T[k,l-1] + T[k,l+1]) / 4;
    }
  }
}
