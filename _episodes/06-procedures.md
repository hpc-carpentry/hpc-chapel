Similar to other programming languages, Chapel lets you define your own functions. These are called
'procedures' in Chapel and have an easy-to-understand syntax:

~~~
proc addOne(n) { // n is an input parameter
  return n + 1;
}
writeln(addOne(10));
~~~

Procedures can be recursive:

~~~
proc fibonacci(n: int): int {
  if n <= 1 then return n;
  return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}
writeln(fibonacci(10));
~~~
{:.source}

They can take a variable number of parameters:

~~~~
proc maxOf(x ...?k) { // take a tuple of one type with k elements
  var maximum = x[1];
  for i in 2..k do maximum = if maximum < x[i] then x[i] else maximum;
  return maximum;
}
writeln(maxOf(1, -5, 123, 85, -17, 3));
~~~

Procedures can have default parameter values:

~~~
proc returnTuple(x: int, y: real = 3.1415926): (int,real) { // 
  return (x,y);
}
writeln(returnTuple(1));
writeln(returnTuple(x=2));
writeln(returnTuple(x=-10, y=10));
writeln(returnTuple(y=-1, x=3)); // the parameters can be named out of order
~~~
{:.source}

Chapel procedures have many other useful features, however, they are not essential for learning task and
data parallelism, so we refer the interested readers to the official Chapel documentation.
