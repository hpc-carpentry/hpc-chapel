## Ranges and Arrays

A series of integers (1,2,3,4,5, for example), is called a **_range_**. Ranges are generated with the `..`
operator. Let's examine what a range looks like; we store the following code as `ranges.chpl`. Here we
introduce a very simple loop, cycling through all elements of the range and printing their values (we will
study `for` loops in a separate section):

```chpl
var example_range = 0..10;
writeln('Our example range was set to: ', example_range);
for x in example_range do writeln(x);
```

```bash
chpl ranges.chpl
./ranges.o
```

```output
Our example range was set to: 0..10
0
1
...
9
10
```

Among other uses, ranges can be used to declare **_arrays_** of variables. An array is a multidimensional
collection of values of the same type. Arrays can be of any size. Let's define a 1-dimensional array of the
size `example_range` and see what it looks like. Notice how the size of an array is included with its type.

```chpl
var example_range = 0..10;
writeln('Our example range was set to: ', example_range);
var example_array: [example_range] real;
writeln('Our example array is now: ', example_array);
```

We can reassign the values in our example array the same way we would reassign a variable. An array can either
be set all to a single value, or to a sequence of values.

```chpl
var example_range = 0..10;
writeln('Our example range was set to: ', example_range);
var example_array: [example_range] real;
writeln('Our example array is now: ', example_array);
example_array = 5;
writeln('When set to 5: ', example_array);
example_array = 1..11;
writeln('When set to a range: ', example_array);
```

```bash
chpl ranges.chpl
./ranges.o
```

```output
Our example range was set to: 0..10
Our example array is now: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
When set to 5: 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0
When set to a range: 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0
```

Notice how ranges are "right inclusive", the last number of a range is included in the range. This is
different from languages like Python where this does not happen.

## Indexing elements

We can retrieve and reset specific values of an array using `[]` notation. Note that we use the same square
bracket notation in two different contexts: (1) to declare an array, with the square brackets containing the
array's full index range `[example_range]`, and (2) to access specific array elements, as we will see
below. Let's try retrieving and setting a specific value in our example so far:

```chpl
var example_range = 0..10;
writeln('Our example range was set to: ', example_range);
var example_array: [example_range] real;
writeln('Our example array is now: ', example_array);
example_array = 5;
writeln('When set to 5: ', example_array);
example_array = 1..11;
writeln('When set to a range: ', example_array);
// retrieve the 5th index
writeln(example_array[5]);
// set index 5 to a new value
example_array[5] = 99999;
writeln(example_array);
```

```bash
chpl ranges.chpl
./ranges.o
```

```output
Our example range was set to: 0..10
Our example array is now: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
When set to 5: 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0
When set to a range: 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0
6.0
1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 99999.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0
```

One very important thing to note - in this case, index 5 was actually the 6th element. This was caused by how
we set up our array. When we defined our array using a range starting at 0, element 5 corresponds to the 6th
element. Unlike most other programming languages, arrays in Chapel do not start at a fixed value - they can
start at any number depending on how we define them! For instance, let's redefine example_range to start at 5:

```chpl
var example_range = 5..15;
writeln('Our example range was set to: ', example_range);
var example_array: [example_range] real;
writeln('Our example array is now: ', example_array);
example_array = 5;
writeln('When set to 5: ', example_array);
example_array = 1..11;
writeln('When set to a range: ', example_array);
// retrieve the 5th index
writeln(example_array[5]);
// set index 5 to a new value
example_array[5] = 99999;
writeln(example_array);
```

```bash
chpl ranges.chpl
./ranges.o
```

```output
Our example range was set to: 5..15
Our example array is now: 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
When set to 5: 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0
When set to a range: 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0
1.0
99999.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0
```

## Back to our simulation

Let's define a two-dimensional array for use in our simulation and set its initial values:

```chpl
// this is our "plate"
var temp: [0..rows+1, 0..cols+1] real;
temp[1..rows,1..cols] = 25;     // set the initial temperature on the internal grid
```

This is a matrix (2D array) with (`rows + 2`) rows and (`cols + 2`) columns of real numbers. The ranges
`0..rows+1` and `0..cols+1` used here, not only define the size and shape of the array, they stand for the
indices with which we could access particular elements of the array using the `[ , ]` notation. For example,
`temp[0,0]` is the real variable located at the first row and first column of the array `temp`, while
`temp[3,7]` is the one at the 4th row and 8th column; `temp[2,3..15]` access columns 4th to 16th of the 3th
row of `temp`, and `temp[0..3,4]` corresponds to the first 4 rows on the 5th column of `temp`.

We divide our "plate" into two parts: (1) the internal grid `1..rows,1..cols` on which we set the initial
temperature at 25.0, and (2) the surrounding layer of *ghost points* with row indices equal to `0` or `rows+1`
and column indices equal to `0` or `cols+1`. The temperature in the ghost layer is equal to 0.0 by default, as
we do not assign a value there.

We must now be ready to start coding our simulations. Let's print some information about the initial
configuration, compile the code, and execute it to see if everything is working as expected.

```chpl
const rows = 100;
const cols = 100;
const niter = 500;
const x = 50;                   // row number of the desired position
const y = 50;                   // column number of the desired position
const tolerance = 0.0001;       // smallest difference in temperature that would be accepted before stopping
const outputFrequency: int = 20;   // the temperature will be printed every outputFrequency iterations

// this is our "plate"
var temp: [0..rows+1, 0..cols+1] real;
temp[1..rows,1..cols] = 25;     // set the initial temperature on the internal grid

writeln('This simulation will consider a matrix of ', rows, ' by ', cols, ' elements.');
writeln('Temperature at start is: ', temp[x, y]);
```

```bash
chpl base_solution.chpl
./base_solution
```

```output
This simulation will consider a matrix of 100 by 100 elements.
Temperature at start is: 25.0
```
